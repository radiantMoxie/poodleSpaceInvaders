# Poodle Space Invaders [Yana Kesala and J. Benjamin Leeds]

## Section 0: Intro
Space Invaders is a classic arcade game that serves as the basis for this computer game. We have taken the base code provided by our instructor and expanded it to be more challenging. Our new alien, inspired by Francois's Critter Class lecture, is a "Galactic Poodle Boss" on a quest for a new haircut. 

The PoodleBoss is drawn from scratch and is larger than the original aliens provided. The class that describes it, PoodleBoss, overrides several of the methods in the class it extends, Alien. The PoodleBoss moves differently. It randomly reappears at a new location on the screen every 15 "ticks" of the timer. The PoodleBoss also has more lives than the original alien and spawns miniature PoodleBosses called PoodleBullets of the PoodleBullet class which incur damage to the Spaceship but cannot be destroyed. All of these aspects make the PoodleBoss harder to defeat. To communicate its desires, the PoodleBoss emits a sound each time it's struck by the Spaceship.
